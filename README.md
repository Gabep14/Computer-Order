# Computer Order
Computer Order is a C++ project where I created a system to process orders entered for a computer manufacturer, where each computer has components such as CPU, Memory, and Storage. The system reads an order file containing the customer name and components of a computer ordered, builds a set of Computer objects, and stores them in a vector. The system then closes the order file, creates an invoice file, prints the invoices for all systems to the file, and prints a summary report to the console when complete. This project helped me explore and learn inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, and operator overloading to model a computer system with many components. All computer objects are dynamically allocated and deleted when not needed. I also learned proper file structure, such as class declarations in .h files and implementations in .cpp files, while creating constructors, destructors, accessor methods, and other methods for each class.
